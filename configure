# This is a shell script and not a Go program because we have to run
# bazel-gopath, and the bazel-gopath tool invokes Bazel on its own.  So, if
# this were a Go program and we wanted to tell users to invoke it with "bazel
# run" as we do for all other tools, bazel-gopath would get stuck because Bazel
# can only run one command at a time.  It's easier for now to just keep this as
# a shell-script so that it's impossible to run it from within Bazel.
#
# TODO(jmmv): Convert to a Go program once bazel-gopath is fixed to not need
# to run Bazel.  (E.g. it could be made to read query outputs from a dependency
# and then have a Bazel genquery rule to supply such data as a dependency.)
